This is a simple, personal frontend dev portfolio made by me, using React (+ Vite) and Tailwind CSS.
However, there's no data fetched, so it is a static webpage (I may change it into dynamic page in the future. It's in the plan)

You can try running this in your computer. After you clone this, remember to:

```npm install```to install any dependencies.
then
```npm run dev``` to run this in your browser.

You can also fork this and make your own version.
